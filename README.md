### 🛡️ File Integrity Verification
To ensure your download did not crash or corrupt, you can verify the file using the SHA-256 checksum.

**Expected Hash:** `[PASTE_YOUR_HASH_HERE]`

#### How to verify:
* **Windows:** Open PowerShell and run: 
  `Get-FileHash .\path_to_file.zip -Algorithm SHA256`
* **macOS/Linux:** Open Terminal and run: 
  `shasum -a 256 path_to_file.zip`

The resulting code should match the "Expected Hash" above exactly.
